# nem-nis1

PizzaFactory/Contorno side dish container that contains NIS (NEM Infratsructure server).

## What's this?

NIS v1 node based on the official Docker image.
This can be run on non root environments.
So it can be on OpenShift and Eclipse/Che with non root mode.
You can get root privilege in the container by `sudo` if your K8s allows.

## How to use on Che7 ?

See `devfile.yaml` in this repository. 
You can change the other dev container if you don't want to use JavaScript.
